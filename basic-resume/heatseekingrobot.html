<h2>About Heat Seeking Robot</h2>
<p>This project was a small group project that was worked on by myself, another computer science student, and a mechanical engineering student. It was part of an introduction to robotics course offered at UCF where students were given the chance to design, build and test a basic robot with the condition that it needed some level of intelligence</p>
<h2>Skills from this Project</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Small team dynamics under pressure of strict deadlines</li>
    <li>Outlining requirements, goals, and establishing a preliminary project timeline</li>
    <li>Making adjustments to a plan under changing circumstances</li>
    <li>Basic embedded programming such as PID control, motor inputs, and sensor data processing</li>
</ul>
